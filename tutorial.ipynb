By default, assumes all halos with a mass above the given value (in solar masses) have galaxies.  However, you can also ask DarkLight to assume all halos have galaxies (`'all'`), or use the occupation function from the EDGE1 sims (`'edge1'`), the EDGE1 RT sims (`'edge1rt'`), or a fit to observed Milky Way dwarfs (`'nadler20'`).\n",

You can also specify `'all'` to have it update the SFR based on the vmax at each timestep. \n",
